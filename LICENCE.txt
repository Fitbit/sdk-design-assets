OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE DESIGN ASSETS, OR
TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Fitbit against all losses,
liability, and/or expense (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of any
claims or suits, whatever their nature and however arising, which may be brought
or made against Fitbit because of your use of the Design Assets in any manner
except as expressly permitted by this License, or for any personal injury,
product liability or other claim arising from the production, promotion,
distribution, sale and/or offer for sale, and/or the performance of the
Developer Applications.

This agreement shall terminate automatically upon your breach of any of the
terms of this License or the Fitbit Platform Terms of Service. Fitbit may
terminate this License for any reason upon 15 days’ notice to your developer
account.

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without
regard to or application of choice of law rules or principles, and controlling
U.S. federal law. Any proceedings arising out of this Agreement shall take place
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California or

this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to
law, all remaining provisions of this license will remain in full force and
effect.
